Objective: Create metadata objects from annotated java code

Metadata extraction process:

Input: a class 

-for every field, process annotations and generate field metadata collection (multiple metadata 
objects may be extracted from an annotated field)
-process class annotations, and generate object metadata collection, or override field metadata

Each annotation will belong to a certain metadata type
An annotable element can have annotations that belong to more metadata types
As a result, after processing an annotable element a list of metadatas will be obtained

Base metadatas:

-Object metadata
-Field metadata 
-Array metadata
-Collection metadata
-Map metadata

Custom metadatas may be defined, that extend these base metadatas, and for each of them 
a set of annotations will also be defined.

Problems:

How do we handle annotations? 
How do we build the metadatas from annotations?
Where/when do we create the metadatas?
How do we obtain the right type of metadata for each annotation?
Where do we store each type of metadata?



Steps in building the metadata:







AnnotableElements ( Class,Field,Methods, etc)

MetadataBuilder for a type of annotable element

-for an annotable element, a metabuilder:
	- creates a metadata object from a factory
	- create an annotable element context
	- sets the metadata object on the context
	- processes all the annotations for that element and saves state on the context
	- saves the super annotable elements on the context
	- starting from the root element processes all the nested annotable elements for
	each element until the original element is also processed
	- for each nested element a context is created and saved on the parent context
	- the metadata for this element is returned
